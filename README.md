# Travel-Agency-Management-System
A Travel Agency Management System Project which enables us to plan a trip and the agencies to add the number of trips where you as a user 
will have the CRUD functionalities alongwith the agency  to provide you the type of trip you want to persue.

It has been done in C++ being connected with the MYSQL as the database where the data associated with every person enrolled in the agency has been reorded,
and this is being operated with the help of XAMPP server.
